# Project Reflection: CubeTech Innovations Homepage

## 1. Tools, Language, or Framework Used
I built the homepage for CubeTech Innovations using some standard web tools to make it look modern and work well on all devices. I used HTML5 to structure the page, CSS3 for the styling and making it responsive, and JavaScript for things like the team carousel and mobile menu. I also added Bootstrap 5 to help with layouts and buttons, and AOS for smooth animations when scrolling. For editing, I used Visual Studio Code, and browser tools to test everything. Since it's just a static site, no backend stuff was needed.

## 2. How You Translated the Figma Design into Code
To turn the Figma design into code, I first looked at the design and broke it down into sections like the navbar, hero, stats, and so on. Then, I wrote the HTML to match the structure, used CSS to copy the colors, fonts, and spacing, and added JavaScript for interactive parts like the carousel. I made sure it looked good on phones and desktops by using media queries and Bootstrap. I tested it in the browser a lot to make sure it matched the design closely.

## 3. Any Challenges You Encountered
There were a few tricky parts, especially with making the site work on different screen sizes. The hero section with the floating card and background image was hard to position right on mobile. Building the team carousel from scratch took some work to get the sliding and dots working smoothly. Timing the animations so they didn't feel overwhelming was another thing. Also, keeping the site fast with all the images and animations was a bit of a challenge. I fixed these by testing a lot and using simple fixes in the code.

## 4. What You Would Improve with More Time
If I had more time, I'd make the contact form actually work with validation and maybe connect it to an email service. I'd also add lazy loading for images to make it load faster, and maybe switch to React for easier updates. Improving accessibility, like better keyboard support and color checks, would be good too. For fun, I'd add cooler animations, like parallax effects. I'd also set up better SEO with meta tags and analytics, and make the site easier to update with a CMS. Overall, it's solid now, but these would make it even better.
